			<p id='intro'>This is a pyramid layout made of li elements. It is best viewed from 757px+ screen width, but you can view it responsively, getting a shape of more like a christmas tree (and maybe that of a robot on even smaller screens). ;) Item IDs are - of course - dynamically generated. There is an ID for the given place within a row, and also a unique ID for each element.</p>
